# **Spam Classification Dataset: Emails V2**

## **Overview**

This dataset contains email data labeled as spam or ham (non-spam), designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like text classification and spam detection. It includes email content (text) and a binary label (spam) indicating whether the email is spam (1) or ham (0). The dataset is suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for spam detection.

## **Dataset Details**

####  1. **Columns:**

 * **text:** The email content (as plain text).
 * **spam:** Binary labels:
     * 1 → Spam email.
     * 0 → Ham (non-spam) email.
####  2. **Data Size:** [Mention the number of rows and columns].
####  3. **Format:** CSV file.

## **Usage**

### Objective

The primary goal is to classify emails as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning models.

**Steps to Use**

1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Perform text preprocessing (e.g., removing stop words, stemming, or using TF-IDF vectorization).
3. Train a machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Deep Learning models.

## Key Features
* **Class Distribution:** The dataset has a balanced distribution of spam and ham emails, ensuring fair training.
* **Preprocessed Text:** Email content is provided in its raw form, allowing users to experiment with their preprocessing pipelines.
* **Application:** Ideal for building email filtering systems or exploring text classification concepts.

### Exploratory Analysis
* **Spam vs Ham Distribution:** Visualize the proportion of spam and ham emails.
* **Word Frequency:** Use WordCloud or bar plots to analyze common words in spam and ham emails.
* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualization
Here are some recommended visualizations:

* **WordCloud:** Highlight frequent words in spam and ham emails.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Understand the classification performance of your model.
* **Bar Chart:** Display the dataset's class distribution.
